## Imaging Technique Inspiration:
The technique I find inspiring is **Halftone**, it is a graphic technique that simulates continuous-tone imagery through the use of **dots**, varying in size (pulse-width modulation) in spacing (frequency modulation) or both, thus generating a gradient-like effect. 

I want to incorporate the Halftone screening technique in my major project combining multiple layers of screens with dots of different shapes and colors to recreate the original painting. It is a highly adaptive technique with abundant screening choices, which helps to present the essence of the original piece and attach a retro aesthetic to it.
